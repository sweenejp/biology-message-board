Punnett squares aghhhhh!!!!!

No just kidding, Punnett squares are nothing to freak out about. They are quite fun in fact. But I'm getting ahead of myself... what are Punnett squares and why do we care about them?

In the previous lesson we learned how offspring (a baby rat, for example) gets one allele of each trait from each of its parents (momma and papa rats). 

Say we wanted to know if the baby rat will have white fur or black fur. A Punnett square helps us keep track of the possible alleles that the baby rat will inherit from its parents. It helps us to predict what color fur the baby rat will have.

This is a bit hard to explain in words - that's why Punnett squares are diagrams. So at this point, I'll let the Amoeba Sisters help explain more.
