Moo.

![A picture of a roan cow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Light_Roan_Shorthorn_Heifer_DSCN1872b.jpg/800px-Light_Roan_Shorthorn_Heifer_DSCN1872b.jpg)

Why the picture of a cow? This cow's fur - wait, does a cow have fur? Is it hair? Anyway this cow's fur/hair is a result of *codominance*. For this cow, the red color isn't dominant over the white color nor is the white color dominant over the red color. They are *codominant.* This is one example of how genetics can get a little more complicated. There is also something called *incomplete dominance*. The Amoeba Sisters will help explain more.

Do you know what blood type you are? Your blood type is a result of combinations of *A*, *B*, and *O* alleles. *A* and *B* are dominant alleles and *O* is a recessive allele. Notice that in this example, there are three alleles (not just two)! This is an example of multiple alleles. Once again, the Amoeba Sisters will help explain.
