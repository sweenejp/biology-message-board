In lesson 15, we learn that there are three major "Domains" of life. Probably every living thing that you think of as interesting falls into the domain Eukarya. Trees, flowers, mushrooms, birds, frogs, dinosaurs, eggplants, chickens, dogs, cats, cows, gibbons, gorillas, dolphins, sharks, bees, and butterflies (just to name a few) are in the domain Eukarya.

Oh, I forgot to mention - humans, too, are in Eukarya.

An oak tree is a bit different than a bumble bee. So why do we put them in the same "Domain". Well even though there is an immense diversity within Eukarya, there is one major similarity. Everything in Eukarya is made up of eukaryotic cells. Their cells have nuclei, endoplasmic reticuli, mitochondria, and all sorts of other fun and interesting organelles. 

In contrast, there is the domain Bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes. They do not have nuclei and other fun organelles. While bacteria might look less interesting, they are super important. Even though they are microscopic, [bacteria make up 13% of the total mass of living things on Earth](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506). That's a little freaky to think about.

Finally, you've probably never even heard of Archaea. Archaea look a lot like bacteria - they also do not have nuclei and other organelles. But they are very different from bacteria. To learn more watch Amoeba Sisters video below.
