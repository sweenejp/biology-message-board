On the [Lesson 2 Post](/posts/ideas-that-shaped-darwin's-thinking-unit-2-lesson-2/), I mentioned how Darwin was not the first person to hypothesize that species changed over time. A French scientist named Jean Baptiste Lamarck thought that species changed over time by passing on "acquired characteristics" from one generation to the next. What in the world does that mean, you ask?

Start this video at the 7:20 mark see how Lamarck thought about species changing over time.

Darwin agreed with Lamarck that species change over time. But he disagreed about how they changed over time. Darwin instead proposed that species evolve due to *natural selection*. *Natural selection* is the main topic of this lesson so let's review it by watching this video from the Amoeba Sisters.

Check your understanding of this lesson by summarizing the difference between Lamarck's and Darwin's ideas. Then, see if you can describe how Darwin would explain how giraffes evolved to have long necks.
