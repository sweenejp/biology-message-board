If you had to guess... how many different species of living things are on our planet? Don't google it. Just guess. Write down your guess on a piece of scratch paper. Okay now watch this brief video from David Attenborough and BBC Earth.

Did you catch the number? Sir Attenborough mentions at about the 0:28 mark. 

Okay the answer is...

Between 6 million and 100 million! Let's write that with the zeros for a better effect.

Scientists estimate that there are between 6,000,000 and 100,000,000 types of living things on our planet. There are possibly more species on Earth than Taylor Swift twitter followers.

A few things to keep in mind. First of all, it's pretty amazing how unsure we are of the total number of species on Earth - a range of 6 million to 100 million is a huge gap. That goes to show how much more there is to explore on Earth. Indeed, new species are being discovered all the time. For example, [new species are regularly discovered in the deep parts of oceans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txSOP_9yLCI&feature=youtu.be). Second, scientists are pretty sure that there are at least 6 million species. And only about 1.3 million have been formally categorized. That leaves about (at least) 5.7 million species yet to be discovered!

Okay, now the 100 million estimate... turns out that could be a bit higher than is likely. [One of the latest estimates](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110823180459.htm) puts the number of species at 8.7 million (give or take 1.3 million). That makes the number of species on Earth about equal to the number of Lindsay Lohan twitter followers - not bad.

Finally, these estimates are for living things that exist today. The number is vastly larger if we consider all of the living things that have since gone extinct (like dinosaurs). The 8.7 million estimates also doesn't count the number of types of prokaryotes (like bacteria). Only eukaryotes were considered.

All of this talk about the huge number of species on Earth brings us to the big questions for this unit. Where did all of this diversity come from? Why is there so much diversity of life on Earth?

Those are the questions that we will be answering in Unit 1.
