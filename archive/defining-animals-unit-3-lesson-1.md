Animals! The kingdom of life that we humans belong to. The Animal Kingdom also includes such variety as dung beetles, tunicates, and dolphins. Since there is such variety, it is helpful to classify animals into different groups.

Sometimes we classify animals into one of two groups: vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates have a backbone and invertebrates do not.

However, this classification system can get a little sloppy because there are many different types of invertebrates and some of them are not very closely related to each other. Some invertebrates are more closely related to vertebrates than to other invertebrates. 

A more precise way to organize animals is to group them into different **phyla.** Remember a phylum is a group one level below a **kingdom.** 

All vertebrates (which includes humans) are in the phylum **chordata.** Some invertebrates are also chordates (in the phylum chordata).

This is a really nice video that explores the variety of life within the phylum chordata. It's a bit longer, but I think it is worth watching.
