One of my favorite TV shows is BBC's Sherlock - a modern version of Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock Holmes is sort of a super hero. But his only super power is inductive reasoning. That is, he observes a crime scene, examines all of the clues available, and comes up with a hypothesis as to what happened. In fact, all of us use inductive reasoning all the time. But Sherlock Holmes observes closer and with better attention than any of us. So while a normal human would look at a crime scene and be uncertain as to what happened, Sherlock Holmes can look at a crime scene and be very certain. That's because he sees more clues than the normal person. Here's a bit of his super reasoning in action:

"Cool, Mr. Sweeney. What in the world does this have to do with Biology class?"

Well, Imaginary Student, it's not a bad way for us to start thinking about evidence. Detectives, like Holmes, need to use clues (aka evidence) to solve a crime. Similarly, scientists use clues to figure out why things are the way they are in the world. Ideally, scientists run experiments in order to answer their questions. But, running experiments isn't always possible. For example, scientists might ask "Why did the dinosaurs go extinct?" We can't really run an experiment to answer that question. We also weren't there to see how the dinosaurs went extinct. So, is it in impossible to know the answer? Well, is it impossible for a detective to solve a crime? After all, the detective wasn't there to actually witness the crime.

Of course, detectives are able to solve a crime even if they didn't witness it because they can observe the clues left behind at the crime scene. It's the same with scientists. Scientists observe clues in order find the most likely answer to questions when no one was around to actually see what happened.

Why is there diversity of life on Earth? How did this diversity come about? These are some big time questions. And just like many crimes, no one actually saw what happened. But, also like crimes, we don't necessarily need witnesses in order to solve those questions. Instead, scientists examine the clues that are available. They then propose the most likely explanation based on those clues - just like Sherlock Holmes. Except, it in this case it wasn't just one scientist, but many, many, many scientists, a few generations of scientists in fact. Each single scientist has added their own clues that they have discovered. There is now a metaphorical mountain of clues available to us. And all of these clues point to one explanation: all living things are related but each species has evolved to be distinct. That's the Theory of Evolution in a nutshell.

Okay, so what are those clues? I'll let this video from Stated Clearly do some explaining.
