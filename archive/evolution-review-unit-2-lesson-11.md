We are already mid-way through the Evolution unit! My favorite thing about learning about evolution and natural selection is that it opens up a world of questions. Most of those questions start with "why." If you are like me, you might even annoy those around you by constantly asking "why?". 

[Like, why are plant leaves different shapes?](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/leaves-different-shapes-sizes)

[Why do peacocks have such ridiculous feathers?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/7/peacocks-tails-eyespots-feathers/)

[Why do zebras have stripes?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/science/zebra-stripes-flies.html?auth=login-email&login=email)  (Note! The answer to this one might be different than what you may have heard.)

[Why are sloths so slow?](https://theconversation.com/sloths-arent-lazy-their-slowness-is-a-survival-skill-63568)

[Why do cicadas only appear every 17 years?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWr8fzUz-Yw)

I'm wondering what questions you have! Fill in the blanks: How did \_\_(some behavior/trait)\_\_ evolve in \_\_(a species)\_\_? Or, why do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ have/do \_\_\_\_\_\__ ? If you'd like, send me webmail with your question!
