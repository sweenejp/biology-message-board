Experiments help us to understand what *causes* a specific *effect*. Will putting fertilizer on my lawn cause the grass to grow faster? Will changing the changing the light to turn back on? If not, will flipping the circuit breaker cause the light to come back on? Will this brand of conditioner or that brand of conditioner make my hair silky, soft, smooth, and shiny? 

You run experiments all the time - even though you might not realize it. Although, our everyday experiments might not be as precise as when scientists run experiments. For example, are you using controls when you test different hair conditioners? Maybe your hair is feeling wonderful this week because you ate a different type of breakfast or you washed your hair in a different water temperature. Maybe one of those things is the reason why you are experiencing award winning hair this week.

^^ Award winning hair.

Point is, we experiment when we wish to see if a different action causes a different effect. Does doing one thing cause something else to happen - that's what experiments ask. 

[The gizmo in Lesson 5](http://www.connexus.com/external/gizmos/default.aspx?idMedia=179070) lets us simulate an experiment. In this gizmo, we can change the environment that a population of parrots live in. We can then see if changing their environment will cause the parrots to change after some generations. In other words, we can test to see if changing the parrots' environment causes them to evolve. I introduce this gizmo in the video below. Make sure you explore the gizmo on your own as well.

Of course, this gizmo is just a simulation. It's not a real experiment. It's difficult to actually run this type of experiment in real life because we can't just change the forest that the parrots live in. It would be nearly impossible to do, not to mention cruel.

However, there have been examples of evolution that we have seen in real life. One of the best examples is how a type of moth tended to evolve to be darker in color during the industrial revolution in England. Watch this video from SciShow Kids for a review of why peppered moths changed. (The video is geared towards younger kids - but it is still very good.)

In the case of the peppered moth, humans changed the moths' environment. But unlike the parrot simulation, we didn't change their environment on purpose. Still, what resulted was similar to an experiment. We can see how changes to the moths' appearance seemed to be caused by a change in their environment. There are many other examples of species changing over time due to changes in their environment. [Finches beak sizes have changed due to a drought.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcM23M-CCog&feature=youtu.be) Sadly, [elephant tusks are getting smaller](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/wildlife-watch-news-tuskless-elephants-behavior-change/) because those with large tusks tend to get killed by poachers. Perhaps most importantly, [bacteria can very easily evolve to be resistant to antibiotics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8)  

In all of these examples, the species changed over time thanks to the variation of traits in their population. It isn't the case that elephants tried to get smaller tusks. It's just that the elephants that happened to be born with smaller tusks (or no tusks at all) were more likely to survive. This is natural selection in action - species change over time if there is a change to their environment. In the other examples above, what were the changes to the finches' environment? What was the change to the bacteria's environment?

That's all for today. I'll leave you with some more pictures of animals with fabulous hair.

Someone needs to ask this dog what his secret is.

This horse may have overdone it with the highlights.

This llama is making a serious fashion statement by wearing dandelions in her hair.

This lion is simply showing off.
