In the previous lesson, we saw how a change in the parrots' habitat led to a change in how most of the parrots looked. Put in more fancy terms, there was a change to the parrots' gene pool. That is, the frequency of alleles changed over time. At the beginning there were a lot of dominant (D) alleles and at the end there were a lot of recessive (d) alleles.

Consider, though, if there were never any recessive (d) alleles in the parrots' population to begin with. Well, that'd mean that all the parrots would only have dominant (D) alleles. Therefore, they would all be dark green parrots. In this case, would the population of parrots change over time if the parrots' habitat changed? Would they still become yellow parrots? It's not impossible... but it is unlikely. In order for that to happen, a mutation that changes a dominant allele into the recessive allele would have to occur in at least one of the parrots.

The point is, populations can change even if no mutations occur in the population as long as there is some variety of alleles in the population. If natural selection favors the recessive allele (which makes yellow feathers) over the dominant allele (which makes dark green feathers), then after several generations, the amount of recessive alleles in the population will increase and the amount of dominant alleles will decrease.

Natural selection isn't the only way a population's gene pool can change. Sometimes, the genetics of a population can change due to random events. For example, what do you expect would happen to a population of parrots if a fire wiped out nearly all of them? How would the genetics of the parrot population change? Random events that wipe out large portions of a population can cause genetic drift. Watch the Amoeba Sisters video below for more. Notice that this video describes 3 important vocabulary phrases:

* Genetic drift
* The bottleneck effect
* The founder effect

All of these terms are related. See if you can describe their relationships to each other.

Here are a few videos that explain *genetic drift*. Just choose one to watch.
