Whenever I'm out and about on a walk and I see another person walking a dog that looks like this...

I think to myself how that dog's ancestors looked like this...

And then I chuckle to myself.

Now, I have nothing against little dogs. In fact, I love dogs of all shapes and sizes. But it never ceases to amaze me how a Dachshund is a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandchild of some wolf (perhaps add a few more "greats" in there). As I'm sure you've heard before, dogs - even tiny ones like Dachshunds - are "descended" from wolves. How is that possible?

The answer is a process called selective breeding. Selective breeding is also sometimes referred to as artificial selection (we'll come back to this term in Unit 2). Your textbook and the lesson go into some detail about how selective breeding works.  This video is also a good resource for understanding the concept.

Selective breeding is, in a sense, a form of genetic engineering. Overtime, it changes the DNA of an organism. However, it's a fairly slow process. What if scientists could actually insert the instructions for a certain trait from one creature into a totally different creature. For example, could we take the instructions for the glow-in-the-dark trait that some jellyfish have...

And insert it into something totally different?

Yes. Yes, we can. 
​
Scientists are able to do this by utilizing much more advanced techniques than selective breeding. We couldn't possibly produce glow-in-the-dark mice via selective breeding because mouse DNA does not have any instructions that are even remotely close to producing glow-in-the-dark stuff. The jellyfish do have those instructions, though. So scientists can copy the bit of DNA that is the instructions for creating the glow-in-the-dark stuff from the jellyfish and insert those instructions into the cells of a mouse. And voila, glow-in-the-dark mice. Okay, it's a bit more complicated than just copying and pasting, but that's the general idea. 
​
The idea of taking a bit of DNA from one species and inserting into a different species is called recombinant DNA technology. And this technology can be super useful! (Not that creating glow-in-the-dark mice isn't useful). An example is taking the DNA instructions for producing insulin and inserting it into some bacteria cells. "Great", you say, "Now we have bacteria that can make insulin."

But this is great! Because those bacteria cells are now little insulin producing factories. And since the bacteria grow and replicate quickly, soon you will have millions upon millions of little insulin producing factories. Then scientists can simply harvest the insulin from those bacteria. And as many of you may know, insulin is incredibly valuable. People who suffer from diabetes need insulin in order to remain healthy.

Okay, quite a lengthy post today. But that's because I find this stuff so amazing! And I hope you do as well. If you want to see in more detail how recombinant DNA works, watch Sal from Khan Academy explain below.
