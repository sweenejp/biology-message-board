In Lesson 1 you learned how the Charles Darwin, a 19th century English scientist, noticed some pretty interesting stuff while sailing the world on the *HMS Beagle* (what a fantastic name for a ship, by the way). I didn't post a video on the Lesson 1 page about Darwin's voyage, but if you'd like a pretty decent recap [you can watch this video from ExtraCredits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRmzmYmMTKk). To sum up, Darwin noticed the following:

* Species are different in different parts of the world. For example, kangaroos only live in Australia. Another example, ostriches and emus are similar yet live in different parts of the world.
* Similar species can be different even if they live in the same area. For example, different types of finches can live on the same island or nearby islands.
* Species seem to change over time. Darwin noticed fossils of animals like the Glyptodon which seemed similar but different from the modern Armadillo. Glyptodon fossils were 2-3 yards long, while armadillos are typically less than a foot long.

Based on these observations, Darwin had some pretty revolutionary ideas bubbling around in his head. Eventually, his voyage on the Beagle would lead him to propose the most influential idea in the history of Biology: the idea that organisms change over time due to natural selection.

But we'll discuss what natural selection is in the next lesson. The thing is, Darwin was one scientist  (or as they were then known, a *natural philosopher*) in a group of many scientists in 18th and 19th century Europe. These scientists were pretty interested in things like, "how old is the Earth?" and "how are mountains formed?" and "what in the world are these dinosaur fossils!?" These curious inquirers made up a broad science community in Europe, sort of like a Science Enthusiasts Facebook group. They might not have known each other personally (or were even alive at the same time) but they would interact with each other. Scientists would write books and publish papers on their latest findings which other scientists would then read. Others would publish responses and sometimes even write nasty letters criticizing their peers. The point is, the science community in 18th and 19th century Europe was growing. More importantly, so was the knowledge that they collectively had. They were discovering more and more clues about the big questions like, "how old is the Earth?"

All of this influenced Darwin. In fact, contrary to common understanding, Darwin was not the first person to propose that species changed over time. A man named Jean Baptiste Lamarck proposed that species changed over time (more on Lamarck in the next lesson). So, Darwin's observation of the Glypotodon fossils was really just a confirmation that species changed over time - something that many scientists already understood (although, not everyone believed them).

Furthermore, Darwin was interested in science's understanding of the age of the Earth. His theory of natural selection would only make sense if the Earth was very old.

So with that long preamble, let's take a look at this lesson's video. This week comes from one of my favorite science content producers - *CrashCourse*. Not all of all of what Hank talks about is entirely relevant to Lesson 2 (although it is all interesting). However, it will give you a sense of what knowledge was available during Darwin's time.
