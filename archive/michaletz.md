Interests: outdoors, ecology, Gaming (video game and tabletops), Platypi, and art of all kinds! Also Dinosaurs. Always need more Dinosaurs.

Hobbies: Professional artist, Ballroom Dance instructor, Dungeons and Dragons, super smash bros., and hearing others stories.

I love film critique (Jurassic park is my favorite), getting to learn hands on about Minnesota’s unique ecology, and just about any artist or nerdy hobby out there. There is always more to learn
