Here are five random animals that I just thought of off the top of my head. 

* Alligator
* Lamprey
* Bald Eagle
* Antelope
* Goldfish

Which of these two animals do you think is the most related? That is, which two animals share the most recent common ancestor? One way to determine this is to think about which two animals share the most specific trait. Can you think of a trait that just two of the above animals share?​

You might have thought, "4 legs." Antelopes have 4 legs and alligators have 4 legs. However, while birds only have 2 legs, they do have 4 limbs (don't forget about their wings). Recall how the bones in a bird's wings closely resemble the bones of the limbs of other animals. So we can only say that alligators, bald eagles, and antelope all share the characteristic of 4 limbs. We can't be certain which of those two are most related based on this characteristic.

You probably didn't think "gizzard!". An alligator and a bald eagle both have gizzards (an organ part of their digestive systems) and none of the other animals do. They also both have lungs, both have, jaws, and both have backbones. All of this would seem to suggest that alligators and bald eagles are more closely related than any of the other animals. An antelope doesn't have a gizzard, but it does have lungs, a jaw, and a backbone. Goldfish, on the other hand, have jaws but do not have lungs. This would suggest that antelopes share a more recent common ancestor with bald eagles and alligators than goldfish do.

You might have thought, "Wait a minute. Goldfish and lampreys both live in the water. Why aren't they considered the most closely related?" The thing is, lampreys do not have jaws. This suggests two things:

1. [They look extremely creepy](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fishing/images/Pac-lamprey_1_1.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false)
2. They share a more ancient common ancestor with goldfish.

Okay, the first thing isn't relevant. The fact that they don't have jaws suggests that the common ancestor of lampreys and the other animals lived a long, long, long time ago. For a more detailed explanation, [check out this article from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/building-an-evolutionary-tree). (By the way, I lied earlier about choosing five random animals. These examples are all borrowed from the linked Khan Academy article.)

What if I gave you three other animals to consider:

* Fruit bat
* Rabbit
* Robin

Which of these 3 animals share the most recent common ancestor and why?

When biologists think about how different organisms are related, they create **cladograms** (also sometimes known as **phylogenetic trees)**. If you draw a diagram of the evolutionary relationship between different organisms, it would end up looking something like this:

For a very clear explanation of cladograms, check out this video from Bozeman Science:
