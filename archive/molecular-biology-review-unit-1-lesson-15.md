Remember that you can take the [Alternative Quiz for this lesson](/posts/unit-1-lesson-15-alternative-quiz/). But first watch this video to help review the concepts we've learned in the past few lessons.

Also, here is an interesting way to look at a codon chart.

This chart helps to remind you that each codon in an mRNA strand codes for an amino acid, and how each of those amino acids are different shapes. Proteins end up having different shapes because they are made up of different amino acids.
