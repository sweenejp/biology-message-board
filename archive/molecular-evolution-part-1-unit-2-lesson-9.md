I typically order pizza about once a month. I'm also really weird and save all of my empty pizza boxes in my garage stacked in order from most recent to least recent. So if you wanted to know how long ago it was since I ordered a large pineapple and jalapeno from Parkway Pizza (my favorite pizza place), all you would have to do is count the number of pizza boxes since that pineapple-jalapeno pizza box. If there are six boxes above the pineapple-jalapeno box, then you'd know that I ordered the pineapple-jalapeno six months ago. 

You could even think of my garage as a pizza box calendar. The number of pizza boxes tells you how many months have gone by. If there were 24 pizza boxes in my garage, you'd know that two years had gone by since I started saving pizza boxes.

Alright, so I don't actually save all of my pizza boxes in order to keep track of my pizza orders over time (I'm weird but that not weird). But, the point is, I could keep track of months by saving pizza boxes. Of course, this would only work if I order one pizza per month. Actually, that's not quite right... it would only work if I order on average one pizza per month.

You're probably thinking, why in the world would you keep track of time using pizza boxes? Good question. You shouldn't. Compost those pizza boxes and move on with your life.

So why bring up pizza boxes and calendars? I'm trying to illustrate that you *can* keep track of time by noting the amount of events that regularly happen over time. Let's forget about pizza boxes for now and instead think of *mutations*. Remember, mutations are random changes to an individual organism's DNA. Silent mutations - those that don't have any affect on an organism's phenotype - tend to happen at a constant rate (just like I order pizza at a constant rate). Scientists can count the number of different silent mutations between two species. Since they know how often these mutations occur, they can then estimate the amount of time it was since the two species shared a common ancestor. This is what known as a **"molecular clock."** It's not a literal clock. It's more like a record or calendar - much in the same way that my pizza boxes are a record or calendar of my pizza orders.

By the way, don't be worried about me. I don't actually save my pizza boxes.

Watch this short video for a clear explanation of how scientists use molecular clocks.
