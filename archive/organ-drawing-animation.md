### Make a drawing, diagram, or create a gif/animation

Choose one of the following organs or organ systems (or choose a different one that isnâ€™t in the list!). The drawing, diagram, or animation should be created by you! You can use the textbook for help. (See below for examples).

You can create your drawing or animation the old fashioned way (with drawing materials and paper) or with fancy-pants computer software. It's up to you!

* Heart (pg 949)
* Lungs (pg 963 - 967)
* Small and large intestines (pg 875-881)
* Eyes (pg 912 -913)
* Ears (pg 911)
* Kidneys
* Liver
* Pancreas
* Something else? Message a Biology teacher if you have a different idea. 

### Add words!

* Describe the overall job of the organ
* Describe how each part of the organ helps it do its job.
* Describe how it works with other organs or organ systems. Just like a car, no part of the body works alone - each organ works together with other organs.
* What things come in and out of the organ?
* What does the organ make (if anything)? Where do things go after they are processed/made in this organ?

Be as detailed as you can. In your drawing, label the parts that you discuss in the description.
