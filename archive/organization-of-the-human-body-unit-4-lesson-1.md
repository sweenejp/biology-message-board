And so we begin our final unit in Biology class this year - the Human Body aka Human Anatomy. This first lesson kicks the unit off by taking a broad view of the human body. We can organize the body into different organ systems and each organ system is made up of organs (interesting how the word "organize" contains the word "organ"). Throughout Unit 4, we will take a closer look at each organ system and the organs that make up those organ systems.

Below is the Amoeba Sisters' take on an overview of human body systems.
