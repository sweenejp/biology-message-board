##### *Note - keep in mind that these videos are here to help you solidify and expand your understanding of the lesson. You are not required to watch all of these videos.*

In Lesson 13, you watched a video that describes how the "operon" works to regulate which genes are "turned on" or "turned off". Quick vocab side-note: when a gene is turned on, we say that it is being expressed. An expressed gene is one that is undergoing transcription and translation. In other words, a cell that is expressing a gene is producing the protein that the gene codes for. 

Anyway, operons are cool but they are only in prokaryotes (things like bacteria). What about more complicated life like plants and animals? How do the their cells regulate what genes are expressed? For example, how does a plant make some cells that are root cells and some cells that are leaf cells? Before we talk about that, let's watch Specialized Cells by the Amoeba Sisters to remind ourselves of all the different types of cells that plants and animals have.

Keep dreaming little red blood cell. Keep on dreaming.

Okay, so after watching that review, the next question is how do cells become different. Again, it has to do with how cells regulate which genes they express. A plant's root cells will have different genes expressed than the plant's leaf genes even though both types of cells have the same DNA. In other words, even though both types of cells have the same genes, root cells express different genes than leaf cells. How do cells regulate which genes are expressed? Well, I'll let the Amoeba Sisters do some more explaining.

If you made it this far, you are an All-Star. But if you really want to go for a home run, you can watch one more video. This video from Khan Academy goes into a little bit more detail about how cells differentiate or, in other words, become specialized.
