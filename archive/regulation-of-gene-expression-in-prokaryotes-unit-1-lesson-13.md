"Okay, Mr. Sweeney. You keep telling me that all the cells in my body have the exact same DNA. And DNA holds the instructions for my cells to do all the things they need to do. But not all cells look the same! I mean, there are [skin cells](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/69/3f/da693f4335c8a8836f1189969d4efafe.jpg), and [brain cells](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HM17p1vDF9A/maxresdefault.jpg), and [muscle cells](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/15/f8/0715f8078d8964ab2db3d59e7998755d.gif). If all these cells have the same instructions, why do they end up looking different? Explain that, fancy science teacher!"

Good question, Imaginary Student! First off, not all of your cells have DNA. [There are a few exceptions.](https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/08/22/why-does-every-cell-in-our-body-contain-dna/) But with those exceptions aside, you are right, all of the cells in your body contain the full set of DNA. If each chromosome is like a text book, then every cell in your body is like the kid who carries every text book from class to class. Again, there are those exceptions, like red blood cells. RBCs can't be bothered carrying around all those heavy chromosomes.

So back to the original question: why don't all cells look and act the same if they all have the same instructions? It's because certain parts of the DNA get "turned on" or "turned off" depending on the cell's environment. "A cell's environment?", you ask. Yes, its environment. When we talk about a cell's environment, we mean things like: the pH level, the amount of specific proteins and other molecules, and what types of other cells are nearby. Certain aspects of a cell's environment can have an influence on whether or not certain sections of the DNA get "turned on" or "turned off." In other words, a cell does not use all of the genes in its DNA.

To help better understand, we will look at an example of how a particular gene is regulated in prokaryotes (bacteria). The video shows how the concentration (amount) of a specific protein turns a gene "on" or "off". This is in fact the same example that is described on slide 3 of your lesson. The PhET simulation on slide 3 might not work on your computer. Watching this video is a good alternative.
