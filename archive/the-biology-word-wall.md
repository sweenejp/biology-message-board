## Help the *Word Wall* grow by contributing to it.

[You can contribute to the *Word Wall* by following this link.](https://www.connexus.com/forum/messages.aspx?idSection=1532462&idForumThread=2025932)

**But Wait! Before you contribute**, read below to see the different ways you can help.

### Add a new word/concept

Do as much as you can of the following:

* Write a short definition or description in your own words. If you use other sources, make sure to cite and (if possible) link to those sources.
* Add related words.
* Add an image (Wikipedia is a great place to look for images)
* Explain the reason for picking that image

### Add to existing words/concepts

Some slides need more work. Add links, images, or any other missing pieces.

### Tidy things up

Some words/concepts need to be added to the index. Some slides have "related words" that need their own slides created.

### Add your name to the "contributions by" text box.

First name and last initial is fine. Then send a message to [Mr. Sweeney](https://www.connexus.com/webmail?hideHeader=true/#/composemessage?idWebuser=2786770) and let him know what you added.
