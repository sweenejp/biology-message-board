##### This is a two day lesson. So take your time as you work through and take notes. As always, the point of this post is to help you better understand what is discussed in your lesson in Connexus. 

This lesson goes over three topics:

* Karyotypes
* Pedigrees
* Sex-linked traits

## Karyotypes

This first video talks about chromosomes and something called karyotypes. We have talked a lot about chromosomes, but you be feeling still a bit confused about what these things are. This video hopefully clarifies some misconceptions. As I said, it also discusses karyotypes. A karyotype is a display of an individual's chromosomes. Sort of like a chromosome snap-shot.

Keep in mind, chromosomes aren't naturally arranged like this. Scientists take a picture of a cell, then arrange the chromosomes in order so that they are easier to look at (actually it's a bit more complicated than that - if you are interested, [you can read more about how lab workers create a karyotype)](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/karyotyping-for-chromosomal-abnormalities-298/). The point of creating karyotypes is to check if there are any problems with the chromosomes. Confused still? Well, thankfully we have the Amoeba Sisters to help explain further.

## Pedigrees

The second video today is about pedigrees. A pedigree is really just another word for a family tree. When I was younger, I went to pick up my soon-to-be puppy and the breeder informed me that my puppy had a pedigree. I thought to myself, "So what? Don't we all have pedigrees?" Of course, what the breeder meant was that my puppy supposedly came from a line of award winning dogs. In turned out that, though my dog was adorable, she was far from winning any awards herself (although that may have been the fault of me, the trainer).

In Biology, a pedigree is a tool for seeing how prevalent a certain trait is in a family. In particular, parents can use pedigrees to see how likely they are to pass on a trait to their future children. In other words, it helps them determine if they could be a carrier for a trait. Remember from Mendel's pea plants, some of the plants were carriers for the white flower color trait even though they themselves were purple. You know what, let's re-write that sentence using our fancy Biology language. Some of the plants were heterozygous (carriers) for the recessive allele (white flower color trait). Pedigrees are very useful for parents to check if they are a carrier for a recessive disease. If both parents are carriers, then there could be a risk that the child gets the disease.

The Amoeba Sisters's Pedigrees video takes you step by step through how to solve a pedigree. They are kind of like puzzles! Fun! ...no? Well, I find them fun. If you like this sort of thing too, you could try creating a pedigree of your own family. You'll need to do some searching for a suitable genetic trait to use, though.

## Sex-linked traits

Finally, the last main topic discussed in this lesson is *sex-linked traits*. I have provided you with two videos to choose from for this topic:
