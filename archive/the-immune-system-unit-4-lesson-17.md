The final lesson in Biology! To wrap up the semester, I can think of no better topic than the immune system. COVID-19 has demonstrated to us all how important it is to understand how our body fights off infections. Understanding our immune system is vital for developing drugs, vaccines, and other therapies in order for us to be prepared for pandemics like the one we are witnessing this year.

There are soooo many good videos on the immune system. It's hard to pick just one to share with you. So here are links to many. Of course, you don't need to watch them all... But, the thing is, the immune system is complex. To truly appreciate it in all of its splendor, you kind of have to watch more than one brief video. So, if you find the immune system fascinating like I do, you might just find yourself watching one after the other.
