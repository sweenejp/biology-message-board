There are a lot of videos describing transcription and translation out there on the internet  - of course, our [beloved Amoeba Sisters have one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oefAI2x2CQM). And if you really want to get into the details [you can check Khan Academy's video on transcription](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/v/transcription-and-mrna-processing).

But I really like the simplicity and clarity of this video produced by "Professor Dave." Alas, if only all of us Biology teachers could be as cool as Professor Dave.

Anyway, the first 3 minutes describe transcription. So you can pause the video there for now. Or you can continue on and get a head start on Lesson 11, because the last 3 minutes describe translation. Transcription and translation in only 6 minutes! Not a bad time investment.

Here is one more video that I like to share. It is a highly realistic animation of transcription (unlike Dave's blocks and circles). This video is fantastic. Do check it out once you've watched Professor Dave's video. It gives you a real sense of how amazing this whole transcription thing is.
