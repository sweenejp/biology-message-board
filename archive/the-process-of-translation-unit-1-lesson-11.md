Watch the second half of Professor Dave's video for an understanding of translation. Remember, transcription is the step where the gene - the section of DNA - gets copied into its close cousin, RNA. Translation is the step where RNA is used to create a loooonggg strand of amino acids. And a long strand of amino acids is... a protein!

Start Professor Dave's video at the 3:00 mark. (If you haven't seen the first half yet, [visit the Lesson 10 page).](/posts/the-process-of-transcription-unit-1-lesson-10/)

Here is a highly realistic animation of translation:

To recap...

**Transcription** is when a section of DNA is copied into a strand of RNA (mRNA to be specific). The cell can make lots of copies of mRNA from a single piece of DNA.

**Translation** is when mRNA strands are used to "print" out proteins. Since there could be lots of mRNA strands copied from a single piece of DNA, the cell can create lots of proteins at the same time.

Transcription and translation is how a simple molecule like DNA can get turned into a complex 3-dimenional protein. For example, here is an illustration of what the protein *insulin* looks like:

###### Note - technically insulin is two proteins connected to each other. It's what's called a "protein complex".

Insulin, of course, has a very important job in our bodies - to help regulate our blood sugars. And, again, the instructions for insulin are "written" in the DNA! That's pretty dang incredible if you ask me.

Insulin is a pretty simple protein. To give you a sense of how complicated proteins can look, here is an illustration of hemoglobin (again, technically it's a protein complex).
