More on the respiratory system from *TED Ed*.

Plus, three short videos to explore the lungs further. First, a video from Ouch Operation. Alright, this video is a bit dorky but it's also very educational. So just try to ignore or (skip past) the annoying parts. Notice in particular at around the 1:20 mark when they show real lungs. They also show an excellent model of how the diaphragm causes your lungs to inhale and exhale.

If you'd like to build your own model of the lungs like in the previous video - [check out this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmy2AXoLZ-4). (Possible extra credit opportunity! - send me a webmail if interested.) Again, notice how expanding the diaphragm causes the lungs to expand.

Now, the model isn't exactly accurate. This animation shows a more accurate representation of the lungs and diaphragm. The lungs are in blue and the diaphragm is in red.

Finally, the lungs are kind of like empty bags but not entirely. They aren't empty like balloons. They are more like a sponge - there are millions of tiny air pockets that fill up with air when the lungs expand. Here is a video of a cow's lung expanding (note - this video is a bit gross).
