Hello Biology students,

Take a moment to read these announcements.

## Semester Conferences

Have you completed your Semester Conference? You can check by looking at your Biology grade book. If you have a score of "10" next to "Semester Conference, then you have completed it. If you have a score of "0" or "0*", then you still need to complete it.

If you don't have it done, [book a meeting with one of the Biology teachers now!](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/contact/)

Did you check? Did you book a meeting if you needed to? Yay! This turtle is very pleased that you did.
