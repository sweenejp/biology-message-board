Just two announcements this week.

## **Unit 4 Final Portfolio**

Instead of Unit Test, there is portfolio assignment to wrap up Unit 4. [You have three options to choose from for this assignment](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-4-final-portfolio/) . Whichever option you choose, you will post your final product to a Padlet (see the link for instructions). You will also provide *helpful* critiques to your classmates work on the Padlet.

## **Feel like you are missing something?...**

Please reach out to me or any of the Biology teachers if you feel confused. You can also revisit the recent [announcements](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/tags/announcements/) if you have missed the announcements in the past few weeks.
