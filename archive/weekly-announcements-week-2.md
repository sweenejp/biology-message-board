Hello Biology students!

It’s bitterly cold outside in all corners of the state. But luckily you can pass the time by learning Biology! Here’s a few reminders as we wrap up the week.

1. Remember that **the Biology teachers teach as a team**! This is why you see all of our names listed next to the Biology course on your home page. If you have questions or need help, you can reach out to any of us.

2. Join Mr. Michaletz for our Biology **LiveLesson today at 1:00 PM**! Remember, you can get to the Bio LL room by clicking the link at the top of the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/).

3. Notice that you can take the **[Unit 1 Lesson 6 Alternative Quiz](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-1-lesson-6-alternative-quiz/)**. Send a message to me (Mr. Sweeney) if and when you complete that quiz.

4. I’m sending this out on Wednesday this week because Thursday and Friday are reserved for the Renaissance Star360 tests. You should have gotten a WebMail from a teacher earlier this week about taking these tests. These tests need to be taken by all students in grades 9 through 11. If you aren’t sure which teacher you are taking the Renaissance Star360 tests with, please just send me a WebMail and I can let you know.
