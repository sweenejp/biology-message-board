Hello Biology students!

Here are the announcements for Week 3.

## Semester Conferences

If you haven’t completed a Semester Conference yet this semester, [please book a time](/contact/) with any of the Biology teachers to do so.

Not sure what a Semester Conference is? It’s just an opportunity for you to check in with a teacher. [Click here to find out more details about the semester conference](/posts/what's-a-%22semester-conference%22/). Note - parents and caretakers aren’t required to be present. It can simply be a conversation between student and teacher.

## Star360 Tests

Thank you to everyone who has completed their Star360 tests. If you haven’t done so, please just reach out to a teacher to let them know.

As always, continue to use the resources that are available to you on the [Message Board](/).
