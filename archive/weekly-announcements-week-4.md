Hello everyone!

Just 3 short announcements to wrap up the week.

1. A good way to increase your score is to take the [Alternative Quizzes](/tags/alternative%20quizzes/). These are available to all students to take.
2. Check out the [Biology Word Wall](/posts/the-biology-word-wall/)! The word wall will grow throughout the semester. But it needs your help in order to grow.
3. Book a time to complete your [Semester Conference](/posts/what's-a-"semester-conference"/)!

As always, feel free to [reach out to any of the Biology teachers](/contact/) when you have questions.
