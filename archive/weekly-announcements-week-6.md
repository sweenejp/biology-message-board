Hi there Bio students.

Here are some important things to notice as we wrap up this week.

**Semester Conferences - (for students)**

If you have not yet spoken with a Biology teacher yet, [please book a meeting with any of the teachers](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/contact/)! The "Semester Conference" is just a chance for you to check-in with your Biology teacher. You can [read more about it here.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/what's-a-%22semester-conference%22/)

Parents or caretakers do not need to attend the "Semester Conference". Of course, if your parent or caretaker would like to speak with a Biology teacher, they are welcome to give us a call.

**Unit 1 Test**
