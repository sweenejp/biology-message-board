Hello Biology students!

These are the announcements for last week (sorry for the delay).Â 

## **A note about the Unit Tests and Alternative Quizzes**

If you hit submit on the test or alternative quiz, then we received your submission. You may have to scroll to the top of the screen to see the confirmation message. If you aren't sure if we got your test/quiz, you can always send a WebMail to Mr. Sweeney.

## **We close to finishing Unit 2!**

Once you have completed Unit 2, make sure to [take the Unit 2 Test](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-2-test/). Only do this if you have completed Unit 2.

## **Have you taken your Unit 1 Test?**

You can check by looking at your grade book. If there is a 0* next to your grade for "Unit 1 Test", then you probably still need to take this test. Please reach out if you have questions.
