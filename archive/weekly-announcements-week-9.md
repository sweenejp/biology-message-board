Hello Biology students!

Take a minute to read this week's announcements. If you happened to miss last week's announcements, [you can see them here](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/weekly-announcements-week-8/).

## 1. Remember to take the [Unit 2 Test on the Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-2-test/)!

* Only take the test if you have completed Unit 2. Don't forget to hit "submit" at the end of the test. If the screen happens to turn blank after you submit the test, you might just have to scroll up to see the confirmation message that you have submitted the test.

## 2. Recent resources

* [Check out this past week's LL recordings](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/livelesson-recordings/).
* Remember that each lesson has a blog post on the Message Board that goes with the lesson. Watching the videos on these posts can be really helpful for getting a better understanding of the lesson. For example, [check out the post that goes with Unit 2 Lesson 17.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/patterns-and-processes-of-evolution-unit-2-lesson-17/)

## 3. Extra credit opportunity

* Next Monday, we will get started together on [this extra credit opportunity](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/extra-credit-opportunity-creating-your-own-cladogram/) at the Monday Bio LiveLesson (10:00 AM). You don't have to come to the LL to complete the extra credit, but it will be helpful to attend.

## 4. Are you missing anything?

* Make sure to check your grade books to see if you are missing your [Unit 1 Test](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-1-test/) or your [Unit 1 Portfolio](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-1-portfolio-mitosis-vs-meiosis/). You can still get both of these things done!
