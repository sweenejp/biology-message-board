Hello Biology students!

You are off to a good start to the second semester! Here are a few reminders:

## The Unit 1 Portfolio

You can ignore the instructions that are on slide 5 of Lesson 4. Instead, you should visit the [Message Board](/posts/unit-1-portfolio-mitosis-vs-meiosis/) for the instructions for the Unit 1 portfolio assignment.

## Keep checking the Message Board

Remember that there are posts with helpful videos that go with each lesson in Biology. These posts are tagged with "[Lessons](/tags/lessons/)". You could also go to the [Unit 1](/tags/unit%201/) page for these posts. Notice that the study guide and note taking guide are at the top of that page, too!Â 

Finally, if you missed this week's LiveLesson sessions, [you can find the recordings here.](/livelesson-recordings/)
