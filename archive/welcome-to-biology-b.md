### Are you ready to meet your teachers and get started?!

**We have put everything you need in one easy to access place!** All class resources and contact information can be found on the class Message Board (where you are right now!) 

Please be sure to bookmark [this link in your browser](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/). You will be referring to it often.

You may have noticed that you have 4 biology teachers listed under the course. We teach as a team, and you can go to any one of us! 

### Please note: 

It is **REQUIRED** as a student here to talk with one of us a minimum of once per semester.  If we can’t reach you, it makes it hard for us to be your teacher.  We want to be there for you, and get to know you, too! You can call or text us at any time. You will see this check-in in your grade book. 

**Remember...**

* You can ALWAYS increase your grade on a quiz or portfolio.
* You can USE YOUR NOTES on assessments.  NOT the Internet. 

**Lab Supplies** | No supplies will be required for your virtual labs this semester. You may disregard the supply list, and complete the portfolios/labs as they appear on the message board. 

**Late Work** |  There are no late penalties, but all  assignments are due at the end of the semester. Temporary zeros for late work will go in at midterm, and two weeks before the semester ends. These zeros are replaced with a score once you complete the assessment. 

**Quiz retakes** |  Not so happy with your score? All quizzes can be made up one of two ways:

1. Taking the Alternative Quiz for that lesson on the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/) (Click "Alternative Quizzes" on the side to find them). Each quiz is labelled under the same unit and chapter as it would be on Connexus.
2. Webmail one of the Biology teachers and ask for quiz/test corrections. For each question fill out this form: [Quiz Retake Form](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-do-quiztest-corrections/)

**Portfolios** |  All portfolio’s can be found on the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/tags/portfolios/). Click portfolio on the side to bring up all posts with Portfolios.  

Portfolios can be corrected, and you have a choice. You can contact a teacher to work together to make corrections in LiveLesson, or work on them on your own. Feedback for corrections are found by [clicking on the score in the gradebook](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-see-feedback/). To send in corrections, you will need to webmail it as an attachment to the appropriate teacher. That teacher is listed on the portfolio post. [How to send an attachment](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-send-a-webmail-with-an-attachment/). 

**Tests** | We write our tests in Google, and you will see them in your grade book as custom assessments. 

The links for your tests will be on the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/), and will also be in the lesson modification notes of the test lesson in Connexus. You will have a test at the end of each unit. We will add the tests to the Message Board once they are ready. You'll be able to find them by clicking on the *Test* tag on the right side of the Message Board. 

[Test corrections](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-do-quiztest-corrections/) are done through the same method as the quiz retakes.

**LiveLessons** | We offer 2 LiveLessons per week, every Monday from 10-10:30, and Wednesday 1-1:45. 

These are already on you planner, and you can copy and paste the link from the planner, or grab the link from the message board to join us. These are both hosted in the Biology Group LiveLesson room, and recordings will be made available on the Message Board afterwards. If you would like a one on one lesson with any of us, please use our "youcanbook.me" links on the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/contact/) to reserve a spot. We LOVE meeting with students!
