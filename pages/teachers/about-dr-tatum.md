Dr. Prima R. Tatum is a native of Beaumont, Texas.  She started her academic career at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas where she majored in Chemical Engineering before transferring to Texas Southern University (TSU) in Houston, Texas; where she earned a B.S. in Chemistry.  Dr. Tatum decided to continue her education in chemistry and she earned a M.S. in Analytical Chemistry, also from Texas Southern University.  While Prima was matriculating through the master’s program at TSU, she discovered her interest in organic chemistry.  After graduating from Texas Southern University, she decided to return to graduate school to pursue a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry at The Howard University in Washington, DC.  After earning her doctorate, Prima left the United States for Nagoya, Japan where she conducted her post-doctoral research studies in drug discovery for the treatment of cancer.  Upon returning to the United States, Prima's focus shifted to helping prepare the next generation of students/leaders to pursue their academic goals and careers in high school and college.  Dr. Tatum has been with Connections Academy for two years, but has over 20 years of combined teaching experience in an online setting, as well as a traditional “brick and mortar” middle school, high school and college setting.
