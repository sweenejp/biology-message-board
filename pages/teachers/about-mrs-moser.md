Back country camping and hiking are my preferredÂ activities; and traveling is a close second! I am fortunate to be able to work from home so that I can actually work from the road! My home base is Florida and I enjoy this paradise by spending my time biking and walking, and staying active outdoors as often as possible.

Looking forward to working with you!
