Oh hey there!

Glad you found this page, it means you are off to a great start! Here is a little about me...

I am passionate about animals, adventure and protecting and preserving our planet. I would almost always rather be outside and I like to be on the move! Motorcycles, horses, backpacking, cycling, kayaking, thrifting, hikes with the dogs...but I also enjoy slowing down for coffee and a good book, playing records, knitting, or binging a show. 

What do we have in common? What do you have in your life that's not on my list? Let's talk about it!
