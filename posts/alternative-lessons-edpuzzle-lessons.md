Welcome to the instructions for the Alternative Biology Lessons! These are also known as the Edpuzzle Lessons. 

###### Note! You should only have access to these lessons if Ms. Johnston, Mr. Sweeney, or Mrs. Ruble informed you that you have the option to do these Alternative Lessons.

## What are the Alternative Lessons?

The Alternative Lessons are on [edpuzzle.com](https://edpuzzle.com). These lessons will replace the lessons in Connexus that have Quick Check assessments. For example, the Unit 2 Alternative Lessons will replace lessons 1-6 in Unit 2 in Connexus. 

When you complete a Unit in Edpuzzle, please send a message to one of the Biology teachers and we will then drop the Quick Check lessons in Connexus for that Unit.

## How to login to Edpuzzle

You should have received a WebMail from one of the Biology teachers about your username and password (this will not be the same as your Connexus username and password!). On [edpuzzle.com](https://edpuzzle.com), click on the "Log in" button (you do not need to sign up - an account has already been created for you). Click "I'm a student", then enter the username and password that we provided you. Once you are logged in, you may change your password if you wish.

## How to do the lessons

Once you are logged in, you should see a list of "classes" on the left sidebar. These represent the different Units in our Biology class. Click on the Unit you wish to work on and select the first video to complete.

## Is this all I have to do for Biology class?

Not quite! You will also need to complete the [unit tests](/tags/alternative%20tests) and the [portfolio assignments](/tags/portfolios). 

As always, [feel free to reach out if you have questions](/contact).
