Cellular respiration is a fancy way of saying how your cells generate energy.

For now, we just want you to understand the big ideas when it comes to cellular respiration. Just watch up until the 3:00 mark with this video. We will be learning more about the details of cellular respiration later this semester.

This is a helpful gif to remind you of the reactants and products of cellular respiration! We'll learn about photosynthesis soon, too!
