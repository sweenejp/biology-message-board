Here is a real life example of an enzyme at work. This is an animation of a strand of DNA getting put together. The big glob thing is an enzyme that puts nucleotides (labeled DNA bases in the animation) together to form a strand of DNA. Remember - nucleotides are the monomers that make up the polymer of nucleic acids. DNA is a type of nucleic acid (that's what the NA in DNA stands for).

In this example, the nucleotides are the substrates, the active site is where the nucleotides come together, and the new DNA strand is the product.
