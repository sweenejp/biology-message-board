## No Unit 7 Test!

We decided to drop the Unit 7 Test. Yay! The Unit 8 Alternative test may end up including some concepts from Unit 7.

## Portfolio #2 - Henrietta Lacks Webquest

Heads up! This is the second (and last) portfolio assignment of this semester. [The assignment is here on the Message Board](/posts/henrietta-lacks-webquest-(portfolio-2)/). You can attempt this portfolio assignment once you have finished Unit 6.

## Check your grade book!

If you aren't happy with your Biology grade, there are likely two things you can do to improve your grade.

* Do test revisions. If you need your test feedback, send a text or WebMail to [Mr. Sweeney.](/contact)
* Check if you are missing your Unit 4 Portfolio. [Completing Option 3](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/homeostasis-portfolio-(portfolio-1)/) for this assignment will not take you too long!
* If you are unsure how to improve your Biology grade, just [reach out to one of us!](/contact) But make sure to do so soon! Which brings us to our last announcement for today...

## Winter Break is less than 2 weeks away!

Make sure to reach out to one of us Bio teachers before break starts if you have any questions!
