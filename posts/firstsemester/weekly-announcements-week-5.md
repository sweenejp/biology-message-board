Here are the announcements for week 5!

## Sample Work

You have two options for the Sample Work assignment in Unit 3.[](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-submit-sample-work-and-portfolios/)

### Option 1

Upload a copy of your Unit 3 Biology notes to the Sample Work drop box.

### Option 2

Upload a screenshot of you completing any of the review Quizzizes on the [Unit 3 review post](/posts/unit-3-review) to the Sample Work drop box.

If you have any questions about the Sample Work assignment, please call, text, or WebMail Mr. Sweeney.

## Unit 3 Alternative Test

There will always be an "alternative test" that you can take at the end of each Unit instead of the test in Connexus. You can take the [Unit 3 Alternative Test](/posts/unit-3-alternative-test) when you have completed the rest of Unit 3.
