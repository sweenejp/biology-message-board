## Option 1

### Design and conduct YOUR OWN UNIQUE laboratory experiment dealing with homeostasis.

* If you want to design and conduct your own experiment, that's great!! Remember that the first steps of the Scientific Method are to make an observation, form a question, and complete research! Search to find a homeostasis experiment that:

  * deals with concepts weâ€™re learning in class (diffusion/ osmosis, body systems and regulation, genetics, etc.)
  * can be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time!
* Send your teacher a WEBMAIL to check on your topic before you begin!
* Design your experiment, carry it out with fidelity, collect data, and write your lab report.

  * You can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_TVvGRIQavf5aqy2fqHc3EmWjCvV-dsqNRPm717POE/edit) for writing your report

## Option 2 (Alternative Option)

### Sample Lab - Homeostasis in the Cell

* This [Homeostasis Lab](https://video.esc4.net/video/assets/Science/Biology/Gateway%20Resources/cell%20homeostasis%20virtual%20lab%20-%20activity/index.html) measures diffusion and osmosis in solutions with varying amounts of sugar.
* **[Watch this LL session](https://www.connexus.com/external/livelesson/?url-path=pzh67r7kvlgc&domain=ue2prod01.livelesson.com) for help with completing the lab!**
* Complete lab online, collect data, then complete your lab report!
