Hey Bio Superstars! 

Many of you are confused about the U5 Biodiversity Portfolio. Hopefully this helps: *You do NOT have to do the option within Connexus.* We made you choices! 

**Step 1.** There are 5 lessons in Unit 5. You can mark lessons 1-4 complete without doing an assessment. Yay! 

**Step 2.** For Unit 5 Lesson 5, there will be a dropbox. Please put a place holder *(image, doc, etc.)* in the dropbox **AFTER** you complete one of the portfolio options. 

CHOOSE ONE:



* [Biodiversity WebQuest](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/biodiversity-webquest/) *(watch videos and respond)*


* [Biodiversity Presentation](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/biodiversity-presentation) *(create and upload directly to dropbox)*
* [Biodiversity Seminar Summary](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/biodiversity-seminar-summary/) *(listen to scientists and tell us what you learned!)*
* [Biodiversity Rabbit Invasion!](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/biodiversity-rabbit-invasion/) *(Fun lab simulation with bunnies!)*

We will be completing the **Rabbit Invasion** together on Wed. April 6 in LL for anyone that wants to follow along and get it done then!
