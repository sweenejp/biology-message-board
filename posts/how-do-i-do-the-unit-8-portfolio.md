Hey Bio Superstars!

Many of you are confused about the U8 Animal Phylogenetic Tree Portfolio. Hopefully this helps: 

*You do NOT have to do the option within Connexus.* We made you choices!

**Step 1.** There are 3 lessons in Unit 8. You can mark lessons 4 and 5 complete without doing an assessment. Yay!

**Step 2.** For Unit 8 Lesson 6, there will be a dropbox. Please put a place holder *(image, doc, etc.)* in the dropbox **AFTER** you complete one of the portfolio options.

CHOOSE ONE:

* [Phylogenetic Tree Lab](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0kKB6iYv0lHkEchncclrNBBue4evRWymiQuhjdWq3JbRqqQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* [Peppered Moth Lab](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScp-HszVvgsUZ_Q_FCvvLmtaIbdeqiN5XX-1BhD6smkI-yTVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* [Evidence for Evolution Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P182x-SUDehCG3t8p8JgcCHflH27qrWz9YhPo7xx5Ec/edit?usp=sharing)

Once you finish your portfolio, you have ONE last lesson in the course! There will be no Unit 8 Test, and No FINAL in the class! After this last lesson, you are DONE!!!
