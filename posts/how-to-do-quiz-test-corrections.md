For any points missed on a test, please use the following format to submit corrections. In a webmail to your teacher, please let us know the name of the assessment you are submitting corrections for. Then, include the following:

* Number you got wrong
* What the correct answer is
* 1-2 sentences explaining why that is the correct answer
* Where you found this information (book page number, lesson and slide number, etc). 

You may submit this for each question you missed.

You can see which questions you missed on a test by checking your [feedback](/posts/how-to-see-feedback/)
