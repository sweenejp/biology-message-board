Hey there fantastic bio students, 

Here are some important class changes to note: 

* Mr. Sweeney has taken an awesome new job, and we will have a substitute teacher starting next week. We will update you soon, but know that you can reach out to ANY one of the bio teachers for help! 


* There is **NO unit test for Unit 3.** Instead you will take an [Alternate Test at the end of Unit 4.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-4b-alternative-test/) Please do not take the Connexus unit tests for Unit 3 or Unit 4. 
* You have a portfolio coming up in Unit 5. There are several lessons in Unit 5, but you can skip through them, and just **submit your portfolio in the dropbox of Unit 5 Lesson 5.**  There are [3 options for the portfolio](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-5-biodiversity-portfolio/), choose the one you like best! 

That's all for now! Reach out if you need us, we care about you. Also, you're doing great. 

Ms. Johnston & Mrs. Ruble
