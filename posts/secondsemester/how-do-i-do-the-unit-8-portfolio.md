Hey Bio Superstars!

Many of you are confused about the U8 Animal Phylogenetic Tree Portfolio. Hopefully this helps: 

*You do NOT have to do the option within Connexus.* We made you choices!

**Step 1.** There are 3 lessons in Unit 8. You can mark lessons 4 and 5 complete without doing an assessment. Yay!

**Step 2.** For Unit 8 Lesson 6, there will be a dropbox. Please put a place holder *(image, doc, etc.)* in the dropbox **AFTER** you complete one of the portfolio options.

CHOOSE ONE:

* [Phylogenetic Tree Lab](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/evolution-phylogenetic-tree-portfolio/)
* [Peppered Moth Lab](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/evolution-peppered-moth-portfolio/)
* [Evidence for Evolution Presentation](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/evolution-evidence-presentation-portfolio/)

Once you finish your portfolio, you have ONE last lesson in the course! There will be no Unit 8 Test, and No FINAL in the class! After this last lesson, you are DONE!!!
