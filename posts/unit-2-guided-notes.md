This link will take you to the [Unit 1 Guided Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vEMrFd4C0htPGr_byGwF7uws0xPeLQGdpqamzyxAjD4/edit?usp=sharing)

You will want to **make a copy** of the guided notes in order to edit it as your own. If you have a Google account, we recommend organizing the notes for each of your classes into separate folders. If you do not have a Google account, you can download the guided notes as a word document. You can then organize your notes into folders on your own computer.

The guided notes are intended to help you stay organized with your notes. You are welcome to customize the guided notes how you see fit.
