For the Unit 2 Sample Work lesson (lesson 12) you have two options. **Just do one of these two options:**

### Option 1:

Submit two screenshots:

1. A screenshot of the Biology Message Board
2. Complete [this Edpuzzle assignment: Biomolecules](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/614898710f6d504191e4e899/watch).

   1. When the Edpuzzle asks for your "nickname", enter in your student ID number. [Not sure how to find your student ID?](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-find-your-student-id/)
   2. Then take a screenshot showing you completed the Edpuzzle.
3. Submit both of those screenshots in this lesson's Sample Work drop box. [Unsure how to submit to a lesson's drop box?](how-to-submit-sample-work-and-portfolios/)

### Option 2:

Submit your completed Unit 2 guided notes. (If you took notes a different way, you can submit those instead).

If you have any questions about the Sample Work assignment, please call, text, or WebMail Mr. Sweeney.
