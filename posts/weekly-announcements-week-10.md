Hello Biology students,

Before you run off for the weekend like a [frilled lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydosaurus)...

Take a few minutes to read the announcements.

1. Unit 2 Test

* Remember to take your [Unit 2 Test](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-2-test/) once you have finished Unit 2.
* Mr. Sweeney has entered in Unit 2 Test scores for those who have taken the test. Please check your scores in your grade book! If you think your score might be wrong, just send Mr. Sweeney a WebMail.

2. Semester Conferences

* If you haven't completed a Semester Conference with a Biology yet, let's get that done! You can see if you have completed your Semester Conference by checking your grade book. If you have a "0*" next to "Semester Conference", that means you still need to get this done. If you have a score of "10", then you have completed it.
* **Remember the Semester Conference is required for all students!** (Only for required for students - if parents or caretakers would like to chat with a Biology teacher, they are always free to give us a call)
* What's a Semester Conference? [You can read about it here.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/what's-a-%22semester-conference%22/)

3. Unit 3 Portfolio

* There is a portfolio assignment in Unit 3. [You can get a head start on it by looking at the instructions here.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-3-alternative-portfolio/)

As always, feel free to [reach out to a Biology teacher](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/contact/) if you have any questions.
