Mr. Sweeney forgot to post an announcement last week (sorry!) so this week's is a little longer than usual. As always, [reach out to one of us Biology teachers](/contact) if you have questions.

###### "What happened to my grade!?!?"

Temporary zeros were entered into your grade books earlier this week. Temporary zeros are intended as feedback to let you know which lessons you ought to have completed by now. The temporary zero goes away once you complete the missing assignment.

## Are You Missing Your Unit 4 Portfolio?

We have posted another alternative option for the Unit 4 Portfolio. This is a very good option to take advantage of if you are missing that assignment. Check it out [by navigating here](/posts/homeostasis-portfolio-(portfolio-1)/) and scrolling to the bottom of the page.

## Semester Check-ins

If you have not completed your Semester Check-in, [now is a great time to book a meeting](/contact) with one of us Bio teachers.

## Portfolio #2 is posted

[We have posted the second](/posts/henrietta-lacks-webquest-(portfolio-2)/) (and final) portfolio assignment for first semester Biology. You probably want to complete Unit 6 before you get started on this assignment. Note that there is not a drop box for this portfolio. You just submit the Google Form.
