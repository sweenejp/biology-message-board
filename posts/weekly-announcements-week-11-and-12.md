## Portfolio #2 - Henrietta Lacks Webquest

Heads up! This is the second (and last) portfolio assignment of this semester. [The assignment is here on the Message Board](/posts/henrietta-lacks-webquest-(portfolio-2)/). You can attempt this portfolio assignment once you have finished Unit 6.

## Check your grade book!

Now is a good time to make sure you aren't missing anything important in Biology. Check your grade book to see if you have a low score on:

* A Sample Work assignment - [see instructions for all the Sample Work assignments here](/tags/sample%20work/)
* The Unit 4 (Homeostasis) Portfolio - [see the options for this portfolio here](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/homeostasis-portfolio-(portfolio-1)/)
* A Test (or Alternative Test) - [you can complete corrections by using this form](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/test-corrections-form/). If you took an Alternative Test, ask Mr. Sweeney to send your test feedback in order to do corrections

## Have a wonderful Thanksgiving Break!

As always, if you have questions about anything, [feel free to send us a WebMail](/contact).
