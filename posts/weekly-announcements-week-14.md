Hello Biology students!

There is just about 3 weeks of school left!

## **Check your grade book!**

If you feel like you are behind, [reach out to a Biology teacher](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/contact/) and we will do our best to help you finish the course.

If your grade is lower than you'd expect and you aren't sure why, you are probably missing a test or a portfolio assignment. Again, please reach out if you have questions.

## **Unit 4 Portfolio**

Remember that there is no Unit 4 Test. There is a Unit 4 portfolio assignment instead. Take a look at the [Message Board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-4-final-portfolio/) to see your classmates' completed work.

## **No Semester Final**

There is no Semester Final Exam in Biology. Once you complete Unit 4 and the Unit 4 portfolio, you have completed Biology B. But if you'd like one last thing to do, you can [write a short post about what you found most interesting in Biology class this year on this Padlet](https://padlet.com/MNCA/ry1mivtolmzuqigb).
