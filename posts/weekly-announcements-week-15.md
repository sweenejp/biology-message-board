**Alright bio fans and friends, listen up! ![laugh](https://www.connexus.com/content/ckeditor_latest/plugins/smiley/images/teeth_smile.png "laugh")**

Here are the things that will help you reach the grade of your dreams! Please check your scores on these items, and complete if necessary. 

## **1. Portfolio's: Do you have them done?!**

* If you were here for unit 4, you have the **homeostasis portfolio** to complete. Not happy with your score? **[Check out the options to bring your grade up or to complete this!](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/homeostasis-portfolio-(portfolio-1)/)** (option 3 is a quick one)
* Everyone has a portfolio for unit 7: **[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks WebQuest.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/henrietta-lacks-webquest-(portfolio-2)/)** This one is really interesting, and only 11 questions long. And, fellow students report that they really enjoyed doing it!

## **2. Unit tests: Connexus OR Alternative tests in Google...you have choices!** 

* If you are missing a test, let's get it taken! [Alternative Tests in Google ](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/tags/alternative%20tests/)

## **3. Semester check in with a bio teacher: 10 points!**
