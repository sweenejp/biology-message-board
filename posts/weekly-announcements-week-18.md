Hello Biology students! I've been slacking on the announcements. I'm sure you are all excited about being delivered some hot and fresh new Biology announcements.

## Temporary Zeros

Today we entered temporary zeros for the rest of the assignments in Biology. If you've completed everything, this shouldn't have affected your grade. If you haven't completed Unit 8 yet, your grade likely dropped a bit. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* These are just temporary zeros! Once you complete those assignments, the zeros will go away. So really, your grade can only go up from here.
* Some of you may have temporary zeros for assignments that aren't on your planner until later this week or next week. We still entered in temporary zeros for everyone because we want you to be able see what your grade would be if you didn't do any more work in Biology class. Again, your grade can only go up at this point.
* If the temporary zeros freak you out, just send me a WebMail and I can remove them for you. Keep in mind, though, that those assignments will get a permanent zero if they are left incomplete when the semester ends.

## Unit 8 Alternative Test

On a related note - many of you have been taking the Unit 8 Connexus test. The [Unit 8 Alternative Test](/posts/unit-8-alternative-test/) is much muuuuuuuuuch easier. Even if you've already taken the Connexus test, you can still take the Alternative Test and we'll just pretend like that Connexus test never happened.

## You got this!

Keep up the hard work and finish strong. Remember that Ms Johnston, Ms Ruble, and I are all here to help - so feel free to reach out if you are confused or stuck. There's no school on Jan 26th and 27th, if you put in the hard work now and soon you'll be relaxing like this panda
