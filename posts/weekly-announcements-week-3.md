Each week we will post announcements here on the Message Board. Mr. Sweeney forgot to post one last week (whoops) so this is the semester's first announcement post.

There are two major announcements for this week: 

* info about the Unit 2 Sample Work 
* info about the Unit 2 Alternative Test

## Sample Work

For the Unit 2 Sample Work lesson (lesson 12) you have two options. **Just do one of these two options:**

### Option 1:

Submit two screenshots:

1. A screenshot of the Biology Message Board
2. Complete [this Edpuzzle assignment: Biomolecules](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/614898710f6d504191e4e899/watch).

   1. When the Edpuzzle asks for your "nickname", enter in your student ID number. [Not sure how to find your student ID?](/posts/how-to-find-your-student-id/)
   2. Then take a screenshot showing you completed the Edpuzzle.
3. Submit both of those screenshots in this lesson's Sample Work drop box.

### Option 2:

Submit your completed Unit 2 guided notes. (If you took notes a different way, you can submit those instead).

If you have any questions about the Sample Work assignment, please call, text, or WebMail Mr. Sweeney.

## Unit 2 Alternative Test

There will always be an "alternative test" that you can take at the end of each Unit instead of the test in Connexus. [You can take the Unit 2 Alternative Test](/posts/unit-2-alternative-test) when you have completed the rest of Unit 2.
