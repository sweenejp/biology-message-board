Hello Biology students!

Many of you have completed Unit 2 by completing the Unit 2 Test. If you are still working through Unit 2, just remember to take the [Unit 2 Test](/posts/unit-2-alternative-test/) before moving on to Unit 3. 

Here are just a few announcements for the week.

* Alternative Tests:

  * Remember that the alternative tests will take a few days before they will be entered into your grade book.
  * After you take an alternative test, you do **not** need to take the Connexus test. Nor do you need to mark that lesson as "complete". You can just move on to the next lesson.
  * You can make corrections on questions you missed on your test. If you want to make corrections, send Mr. Sweeney a WebMail to ask him for a copy of your completed test. Then you can make your corrections by [clicking here](/posts/test-corrections-form).
* Unit 3 Help

  * There are helpful posts with videos on the Unit 3 page. [Check it out.](/tags/unit%203/)
