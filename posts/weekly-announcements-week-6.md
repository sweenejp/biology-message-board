Sorry that the announcements didn't show up until Friday this week! Better late than never.

## Unit 3 Alternative Test

[The Unit 3 Alternative Test is on the Message Board.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/unit-3-alternative-test/) Please take this test once you complete Unit 3. We will drop the Connexus Unit 3 Test shortly after you take this test.

## Test Corrections

Remember that you can always make test corrections. If you'd like to make test corrections on an Alternative Test, [send a WebMail to Mr. Sweeney](https://www.connexus.com/webmail?hideHeader=true/#/composemessage?idWebuser=2786770) to get your feedback from that test. Test corrections can improve your grade! [The test correction form is on the Message Board.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/test-corrections-form/)

## Unit 4 Portfolio

Notice that there is an alternative option for the [Unit 4 Portfolio (see Option 2)](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/homeostasis-portfolio/). It involves completing a virtual lab. You will then write and submit a lab report about the virtual lab. You are welcome to try Option 1 if you'd like! Just send a message to a Biology teacher for help getting started.

That's all for this week's announcements. Have a great weekend!
