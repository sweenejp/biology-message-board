## Semester Check-in reminder

Every student is required to complete a "semester check-in" with one of the Biology teachers. You may have already earned credit for your semester check-in. Take a look at your grade book see if you need to complete it. 

* if you have a score of 5/5 on the semester check-in assignment, you are all set
* if there is no score next to the semester check-in assignment, it is incomplete. You can [book a meeting with a Biology teacher](/contact) to fix that.
