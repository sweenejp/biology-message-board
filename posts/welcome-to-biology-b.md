Welcome to the wonderful world of BIOLOGY!!

All class resources and contact information can be found on the class [Message Board](/)!

Please note : It is REQUIRED as a student here to talk with your teacher a minimum of once per semester. If we canâ€™t reach you, it makes it hard for us to be your teachers. We want to be there for you, and get to know you! You also must complete 80% of lessons at a minimum to receive a passing grade in the course (you can't just do the big stuff, and ignore all of the quick check lessons).

You can ALWAYS increase your grade on a test or portfolio. There is an alternative version of each test on the message board that we prefer you to take, and there are multiple options for each portfolio. You can take both the alternative option and standard test in connexus and we will take your highest score.

You can USE YOUR NOTES on assessments. NOT the Internet.

Please CONTACT US when you need something! If you have a question, you can call or text your Biology teacher (either Ms. Johnston, Ms. Ruble, or Mr. Sweeney - we all work together as a team). You can also book a time to meet in our LiveLesson rooms. [What is a LiveLesson room anyway](/posts/what's-a-livelesson-room)?

We are looking forward to this semester!

Sincerely, your MNCA Biology teachers
